Description:
    Generates rake tasks for backups and restores to and from amazon s3.
    You will need to edit 'config/s3_config.yml' and fill in your AWS
    credentials and you will need to edit 'db/secret.txt' to set your
    own secret encryption key (any long and complicated string will do).

Example:
    rails generate s3db_config

    This will create:
        lib/tasks/s3db_backup.rake
        config/s3_config.yml
        db/secret.txt
